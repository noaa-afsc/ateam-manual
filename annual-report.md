### 2. Scope Statement
* This is an annual summary of [[Fisheries Monitoring and Analysis Division|FMA]] and [[Alaska Regional Office]] activities for the year prior.  This is a joint project between [[Fisheries Monitoring and Analysis Division|FMA]]'s [[Analytical Services Program]], other members of [[Fisheries Monitoring and Analysis Division|FMA]], [[Alaska Regional Office]] and [[NOAA Office of Law Enforcement]].
* The Annual Report provides information, analysis, and recommendations based on the deployment of observers and Electronic Monitoring (EM) systems by the North Pacific Observer Program (Observer Program) in the halibut and groundfish fisheries off Alaska. Section 313 of the Magnuson-Stevens Act (16 U.S.C. 1862) authorizes the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council), in consultation with National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), to prepare a fishery research plan for the purpose of stationing observers and EM systems to collect data necessary for the conservation, management, and scientific understanding of the commercial groundfish and Pacific halibut fisheries of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI) and Gulf of Alaska (GOA) management areas. Observers and EM systems collect fishery-dependent information used to estimate total catch and interactions with protected species. Managers use these data to manage groundfish and prohibited species catch within established limits and to document and reduce fishery interactions with protected resources. Scientists use fishery-dependent data to assess fish stocks, to provide scientific information for fisheries and ecosystem research and fishing fleet behavior, to assess marine mammal interactions with fishing gear, and to assess fishing interactions with habitat. 
* The Observer Program is the nation’s largest observer program and covers vessels in both partial coverage and full coverage. In the full coverage component of the program, every trip is monitored by 1 or 2 observers and the vast majority of groundfish harvest is covered by this portion of the program. Each year, the Annual Deployment Plan (ADP) describes the science-driven method for deployment of observers and EM systems on vessels in the partial coverage component of the program (50 CFR 679.51(a)). The ADP specifies the scientific deployment design for the partial coverage fisheries and the selection rate—the portion of trips that are sampled by observers and EM. 
* The following year, the agency provides an Annual Report with descriptive information and scientific evaluation of the deployment of observers and EM. The ADP and Annual Report process provides information to assess whether the objectives of the Observer Program have been met and a process to make recommendations to improve implementation of the program to further these objectives.
- ###  What are the Outcomes and Deliverables?
	* Draft Written Report
	* Oral Presentations
		* SSC - slide deck and oral presentation
		* AP & NPFMC - slide deck and oral presentation
	* Final Report - published as a processed report

## 3.3 Team Processes
Defines when and how we work.
- ### AR Report Team Meetings
	- Meet every 2 weeks, Monday afternoons roughly March thru May
	- Bi-Weekly Agenda - typically meetings are round table with each section/chapter providing updates as needed.  If other topics need to be covered, please feel free to add them to the written agenda either before the meeting or bring them to the attention of the meeting chair at the start of the meeting.
	- We recognize not all members will make every meeting. Please indicated on the calendar invite if you cannot make it. 
	- Treat each other with respect and dignity. [AFSC's Code of Conduct, Jan 2025](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dkH1qQlf8PpbY03lneRjHsVB1XnaHPbu/view) will help guide our interactions.
- ### Chapter/Section Team Meetings
	It is the responsibility of the individual chapter/section teams, to develop some protocols/systems/norms of collaboration.  Develop them to the degree and formality that works for the team. Some things to consider:
	- Meeting frequency
	- Meeting attendance
	- How agendas are made
	- Participation
	- How tasks are assigned
	- Conflict resolution - Develop mechanisms within your team to handle decision-making and challenges. Please flag seemingly intractable issues as early as possible and bring in the AFSC and AKRO leads as needed.
	- Develop concrete definitions of "complete" for each stage, e.g., analysis, visualizations, writing, etc.
