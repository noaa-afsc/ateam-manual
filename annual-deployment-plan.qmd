# Project Plan

### 1. Project Goals and Deliverables
##### 1.1 Goals
- The Annual Deployment Plan (ADP) describes how the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) intends to assign at-sea and shoreside fishery observers and electronic monitoring (EM) to vessels and processing plants engaged in halibut and groundfish fishing operations in the North Pacific.

----

##### 1.2 Deliverables
- Two Reports: draft & final
- Draft Plan (October)
	- presentation of Draft Plan to Fishery Monitoring Advisory Committee and Partial Coverage Fishery Monitoring Advisory Committee(PCFMAC)
	- presentation of Draft Plan to NPFMC AP and Main Council, typically as a stand alone item under Agenda C.
- Final Plan (December)
	- report of Final ADP given to NPFMC AP and Main Council, typically as part of the NMFS B2 Report. Staff are present for questions but do not provide a formal presentation.

----

### 2. Scope Statement
- The ADP is developed under the authority of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act) (16 U.S.C. 1862), the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Management Area (BSAI FMP), the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA FMP), and the Northern Pacific Halibut Act of 1982. 
- The ADP outlines the science-driven method for deployment of observers and EM systems to support statistically reliable data collection. The ADP is a core element in implementation of section 313 of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, which authorizes the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) to prepare a fishery research plan in consultation with NMFS.
- The Council’s role in the annual deployment plan process is described in the analysis that was developed to support the restructured observer program (NPFMC 2011) and in the preamble to the proposed rule to implement the restructured observer program (77 FR 23326). The preamble to the proposed rule notes that NMFS would consult with the Council each year on the deployment plan for the upcoming year. In addition, the Council would: 
	- Select a meeting for the annual report consultation that provides sufficient time for Council review and input to NMFS. The Council would likely need to schedule this review for its October meeting. 
	- Not formally approve or disapprove the annual report, including the deployment plan, but NMFS would consult with the Council on the annual report to provide an opportunity for Council input. 
	- The final deployment plan would be developed per NMFS' discretion to meet data needs for conservation and management. (77 FR 23344 & 23345). 
- The ADP follows the process envisioned by the Council and NFMS when the restructured observer program was developed and implemented. As a result, both the ADP development and the evaluation of data collected by observers and EM is an ongoing process.
- NMFS is committed to working with the Council throughout the annual review and deployment cycle to identify improved analytical methods and ensure Council and public input is considered.
- More details on the legal authority and purpose of the ADP are found in the Final Rule for Amendment 86 to the BSAI FMP and Amendment 76 to the GOA FMP (77 FR 70062, 21 November 2012). Further details on the integration of EM deployment into the ADP process are found in the final rule to integrate EM into the Observer Program (82 FR 36991).

##### 3.3 Stakeholders
- NPFMC
- AK Fishing Industry

----

### 4. Project Assumptions, Risks, Constraints 
##### 4.1 Assumptions
- Authors know shoreside plant operations with minimal error.
- Fishing effort is predictable based on data from previous years.
- Proximity allocation method adequately identifies spatio-temporal gaps in sampling.
- Fishers are not fishing differently with vs. without monitoring.

----

##### 4.2 Risks
- Overspending our budget.
- Not monitoring all of the trips (days) that are high-cost. Cost-efficiency only comes when we monitor all the high-cost days (ca. 1100-1300 days) because then the per-day cost drops.

----

##### 4.3 Constraints
- Budget
- Trade-off between shoreside EM monitoring and at-sea human observing

### 6. Budget
- Full coverage fisheries are "pay-as-you-go" system where vessels or plant operators contract directly with observer and EM providers to purchase monitoring services.  These fisheries have 100% monitoring.

- The vessels fishing in the partial coverage fisheries with less than 100% monitoring pay a 1.6% landing fee (as of `r Sys.Date()`) on each delivery. This pays for both shoreside and at-sea monitoring using both human observers as well as EM.
